/**
 * Palmer's algorithm for computing Hamiltonian cycles in graphs that meet Ore's condition. Ore gave
 * a sufficient condition for a graph to be Hamiltonian, essentially stating that a graph with
 * sufficiently many edges must contain a Hamilton cycle.
 *
 * Specifically, Ore's theorem considers the sum of the degrees of pairs of non-adjacent vertices:
 * if every such pair has a sum that at least equals the total number of vertices in the graph, then
 * the graph is Hamiltonian.
 *
 * <p>
 * A Hamiltonian cycle, also called a Hamiltonian circuit, Hamilton cycle, or Hamilton circuit, is a
 * graph cycle (i.e., closed loop) through a graph that visits each node exactly once (Skiena 1990,
 * p. 196).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This is an implementation of the CRISS-CROSS algorithm described by E. M. Palmer in his paper.
 * The algorithm takes a simple graph that meets Ore's condition (see
 * {@link GraphTests#hasOreProperty(Graph)}) and returns a Hamiltonian cycle. The algorithm runs in
 * $O(|V|^3)$ time and uses $O(|V|)$ space. In contrast to the most other algorithms in this package
 * this algorithm does only attempt to find any Hamiltonian cycle in the graph and does not attempt
 * to find the shortest cycle. The advantage of this algorithm is that accepted graphs only need to
 * meet Ore's condition which is less strict than the completeness requirement of most of the other
 * algorithms.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The original algorithm is described in: Palmer, E. M. (1997), "The hidden algorithm of Ore's
 * theorem on Hamiltonian cycles", Computers &amp; Mathematics with Applications, 34 (11): 113â€“119,
 * doi:10.1016/S0898-1221(97)00225-3
