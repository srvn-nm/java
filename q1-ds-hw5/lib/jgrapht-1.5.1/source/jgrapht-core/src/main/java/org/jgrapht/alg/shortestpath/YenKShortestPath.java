/**
 * Implementation of Yen`s algorithm for finding $k$ shortest loopless paths.
 *
 * <p>
 * The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(kn(m + n log n))$, where $n$ is the number of vertices
 * in the graph, $m$ is the number of edges in the graph and $k$ is the number of paths needed.
 *
 * <p>
 * The algorithm is originally described in: Q. V. Martins, Ernesto and M. B. Pascoal, Marta.
 * (2003). A new implementation of Yenâ€™s ranking loopless paths algorithm. Quarterly Journal of the
 * Belgian, French and Italian Operations Research Societies. 1. 121-133. 10.1007/s10288-002-0010-2.
 *
 * <p>
 * The implementation iterates over the existing loopless path between the {@code source} and the
 * {@code sink} and forms the resulting list. It is possible to provide a {@link PathValidator} to
 * filter the resulting path list
 *
 * @param <V> the graph vertex type
 * @param <E> the graph edge type
